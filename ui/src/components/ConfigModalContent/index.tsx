      <p>
        Configuration files are required for running SEP-6, 12, and 31 tests.
        These files provide information required for the test suite to interact
        with your anchor service properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Configuration files are JSON-formatted and have top-level keys for each
        SEP for which tests are run.

        SEP-12 configuration objects are used for specifying the customer data
