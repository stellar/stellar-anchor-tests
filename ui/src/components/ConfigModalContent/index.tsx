      <p>
        Configuration files are required for running SEP-6, 12, 31 and 38 tests,
        and is optional for SEP-24 tests. These files provide information needed
        for the test suite to interact with your anchor service properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Configuration files are JSON-formatted and have top-level keys for each
        SEP for which tests are run.

      <Heading4>SEP-24 (optional*)</Heading4>
      <p>
        SEP-24 configuration objects are used for specifying the account
        credentials and transaction parameters that should be used when making
        GET /transaction requests for fetching pending and completed
        transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        *This SEP-24 configuration object is <strong>optional</strong> so
        Anchors are able to initially skip the tests for pending and completed
        transactions. But we <strong>strongly encourage</strong> Anchors to
        succeed with ALL tests in order to minimize issues before onboarding
        with a new wallet.
